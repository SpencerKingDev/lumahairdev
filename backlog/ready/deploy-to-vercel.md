# Deploy to Vercel instead of gh-pages

## Why

Workspace-wide decision (2026-08-25): web apps deploy to Vercel, not GitHub Pages. This site
currently serves `dev.lumahairstudio.com` from the `gh-pages` branch via the `gh-pages` npm
package.

## What's already known

- Current setup: `homepage` in `package.json` points at the domain, `public/CNAME` holds
  `dev.lumahairstudio.com`, deploys push a build to the `gh-pages` branch.
- The sibling repo `lumahairstudio` serves `www.lumahairstudio.com` the same way and has its own
  copy of this item. Two repos → two Vercel projects, mirroring the current structure; both
  domains sit under one registrar, so doing the DNS work for both in one sitting is the efficient
  path. As the dev site, this one is the safer first cutover.
- Migration steps, in order:
  1. Create the Vercel project (`vercel link` / import the GitHub repo) with the GitHub
     integration, so pushes to the default branch auto-deploy.
  2. Add `dev.lumahairstudio.com` as the project's domain and update DNS at the registrar to
     Vercel's records. Verify the domain serves the Vercel deployment before touching anything else.
  3. Only then clean up: remove the `gh-pages` devDependency and any deploy scripts, remove
     `homepage` from `package.json` (CRA derives `PUBLIC_URL` from it; Vercel serves at root),
     delete `public/CNAME`.
- The `gh-pages` branch is a deployment branch: it stays until the cutover is verified, and even
  then deleting it is a separate act taken only with explicit confirmation — never as part of this
  item's routine work.
